## Why Gruvi?

### All-in-one platform
Most competitors focus on one capability — video OR music OR voiceover. Gruvi combines music generation, video production, voiceover synthesis, avatar creation, and social publishing into a single workflow. No need to stitch together Sora + ElevenLabs + CapCut + a scheduler.

### Speed and cost efficiency
A song generates in under 30 seconds. A full music video in 2–5 minutes. Compare that to hiring a producer, videographer, and editor — or even using manual tools that require hours of editing.

### Commercial-ready output
All content is royalty-free with commercial licensing included on every plan. No separate licensing fees or attribution requirements.

### Built for short-form content
Gruvi is optimized for the formats that drive engagement: TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts. Portrait-first video generation, viral-optimized music lengths, and direct social publishing.

### Multilingual by default
Generate music with lyrics in 24+ languages. Create voiceovers and content for global audiences without translation services.

### Character consistency
Upload reference images and maintain consistent characters across multiple videos and content pieces — critical for brand storytelling and series content.
