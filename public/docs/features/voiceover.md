Hook (2-3 seconds) → Problem (5 seconds) → Solution (10 seconds) → CTA (3 seconds)
```

### Example: Product Review Style
```
"Okay so I've been using this for two weeks now and I have to tell you...
this actually works. Like, I was skeptical at first, but look at the difference.
If you're struggling with [problem], you need to try this.
Link in bio, trust me on this one."
```

### Example: Educational
```
"Here's something most people don't know about [topic].
When you [action], it actually causes [effect].
Instead, try [solution]. This works because [reason].
Save this for later."
```

## Best Practices

1. **Write naturally** - How people actually speak, not formal writing
2. **Keep it short** - Social content = 15-60 seconds
3. **Use conversational hooks** - "Okay so...", "Here's the thing..."
4. **Include pauses** - Use "..." for dramatic effect
5. **End with action** - Clear CTA or save prompt
