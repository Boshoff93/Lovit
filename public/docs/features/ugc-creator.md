# UGC Creator

Generate influencer-style product videos with AI avatars.

## Overview

UGC (User Generated Content) Creator produces authentic-looking product demo videos - the kind that perform best on TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.

## Token Cost

**50 tokens per 5 seconds** of video
- 15-second video = 150 tokens
- 30-second video = 300 tokens

## Why UGC Style?

UGC-style content outperforms traditional ads because:
- Feels authentic and relatable
- Looks like organic content
- Higher engagement rates
- Better conversion rates
- Lower cost than hiring influencers

## Creation Methods

### Method 1: Prompt-Based (Recommended)

Write a description of what you want:

```
A young woman excitedly unboxing a new skincare product,
showing the texture, applying it, and reacting positively.
Clean, well-lit bathroom setting.
```

**Why this works best:**
- Most creative freedom
- AI optimizes for engagement
- Natural variations each time

### Method 2: Use Existing Voiceover

1. Create a voiceover first (see [Voiceover Guide](./voiceover.md))
2. Select it in UGC Creator
3. AI generates matching visuals

### Method 3: Combine Prompt + Voice Change

The most powerful option:
1. Write your prompt
2. Enable "Voice Change"
3. Select target voice personality
4. Get UGC video with perfect voice match

## Best Practices

### Product Integration

For best results:
1. Create a Product asset first (see [AI Assets](./ai-assets.md))
2. Reference it in your UGC prompt
3. AI will feature the product naturally

### Script Structure (15-30s)

```
HOOK (0-3s): Grab attention
"Okay I have to show you guys something..."

PROBLEM (3-8s): Relate to viewer
"You know how [common pain point]?"

SOLUTION (8-20s): Show product
"This [product] actually [benefit]..."

PROOF (20-25s): Demonstrate
[Show product in action]

CTA (25-30s): Call to action
"Link in bio if you want to try it"
```

### Voice Change Options

Voice change transforms the AI-generated voice to match specific personalities:

| Voice Type | Best For |
|------------|----------|
| Young Female | Beauty, Fashion, Lifestyle |
| Young Male | Tech, Gaming, Fitness |
| Professional | B2B, Finance, Education |
| Enthusiastic | Products, Launches, Reviews |
