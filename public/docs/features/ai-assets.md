# AI Assets

Create reusable assets for consistent content creation.

## Overview

AI Assets are reference materials that help Gruvi generate consistent content. Once you create an asset, you can use it across multiple videos to maintain brand consistency.

## Asset Types

### Human

AI-generated character references that can be used in:
- UGC Creator videos
- Character Swap
- Music videos
- Any video generation

**How to create:**
1. Go to AI Assets → Human
2. Option A: Upload reference photos (2-5 images work best)
3. Option B: Generate with a prompt describing the character
4. Save the asset for reuse

**Example prompt:**
```
A professional woman in her 30s, friendly smile,
brown hair, business casual attire,
warm and approachable expression
```

### Non-Human

Characters that aren't human - mascots, animals, creatures:
- Brand mascots
- Animated characters
- Animals
- Fantasy creatures

**Example prompt:**
```
A friendly cartoon owl mascot, wearing glasses,
holding a book, blue and gold colors,
suitable for an education brand
```

### Product

E-commerce and product assets for promotional videos:
- Physical products
- Packaging
- Product in-use shots
- Multiple angles

**How to create:**
1. Upload product photos (multiple angles recommended)
2. Or describe the product for AI generation
3. Use in UGC Creator and promotional videos

**Tips:**
- White background photos work best
- Include packaging shots
- Show product in use if possible
- Multiple angles = better results

### Place

Location and environment assets:
- Store locations
- Office spaces
- Outdoor settings
- Event venues

**Use cases:**
- Consistent background across videos
- Brand location integration
- Setting for character videos

**Example prompt:**
```
A modern, minimalist coffee shop interior,
natural wood tables, large windows,
plants, warm lighting, Instagram-worthy aesthetic
```

### App / Software

Create assets from app screenshots for tech product videos:
1. Upload screenshots of your app
2. Gruvi creates an app asset
3. Use with App Showcase to create demo videos

**Best practices:**
- Capture key screens
- Show main features
- Include onboarding flow
- Light and dark mode if available

## Using Assets in Videos

### In UGC Creator
```
Reference: [Your Product Asset]

Prompt: An excited person unboxing and reviewing
the product, showing its features...
```

### In Character Swap
1. Select source video
2. Choose your Human asset as the replacement character
3. Generate

### In App Showcase
1. Select your App asset
2. Choose video style
3. Add music or voiceover
4. Generate promotional video

## Asset Management

### Organizing Assets
- Name assets clearly
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Group related assets (e.g., "Brand X - Product Line")

### Updating Assets
- Add more reference images to improve consistency
- Update prompts to refine character
- Assets improve with more data

### Sharing Assets
- Assets are account-specific
- Can be used across all videos in your account
- Multi-account users: assets don't transfer between accounts

## Token Costs

**Asset creation is free** - you only pay when using assets in video generation.

## Best Practices

1. **Invest in good assets** - Better assets = better videos
2. **Multiple references** - 3-5 images beat 1 image
3. **Consistent style** - Match asset style to your brand
4. **Update regularly** - Add new angles/variations
5. **Test before scaling** - Generate test video before batch creating
