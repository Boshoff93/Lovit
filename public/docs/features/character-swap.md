## Using AI Assets

For best character swap results:

1. **Create a Human Asset first**
   - Go to AI Assets → Human
   - Upload reference images or generate
   - This creates a consistent character

2. **Use that asset in swaps**
   - The AI maintains character consistency
   - Works across multiple videos
   - Builds brand character recognition

## Source Video Options

### Upload Your Own
- Upload any video file
- Must have clear person(s) visible
